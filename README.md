# RegisterLevel_C_StructAndEnum
 How we can write program at c by using enum and struct expressions.

## Notes
-And also i will show the struct variables on the ram. And explain the relation between using global and static methods like sending variable by using its ram address.

### REGISTER TABLE OF SENSOR BMP280
![Register_table](https://github.com/YEK-Kayra/RegisterLevel_C_StructAndEnum/assets/124110070/3e09f87e-1864-48f9-9888-de8aa2ec2d47)
In this table we are seeing the memory map of BMP280 pressure and temperature sensor. But when we look at the code is different. 
I try to explain that how we can read memory map, and its byte parts, what does it mean 'enum' and how we can use it with sensor and so on.

In this table i try to show you that how we use struct and what kind of way to combine other code parts. Structs are like a tree that grown up from thick branch to thin.
